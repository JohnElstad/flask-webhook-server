System Prompts Configuration

This file contains all system prompts and first messages organized by sourceforai field values.
Add new prompts and first messages here for different use cases by adding new entries to the dictionaries.

Usage:
- The key is the value of the 'sourceforai' field from the GoHighLevel webhook
- SYSTEM_PROMPTS: The system prompt that will be used for that source
- FIRST_MESSAGES: The first message that will be sent to the contact
- Use 'default' as the fallback key for any sourceforai values not explicitly defined
"""

    # Default prompt - used when sourceforai is not found or is empty
